# Defects and Lessons Learned

This file tracks defects discovered during implementation that should inform future spec revisions or implementations.

## Format

Each defect should include:
- **ID**: Unique identifier (D001, D002, etc.)
- **Phase/Task**: Which task revealed the issue
- **Category**: Spec gap | Implementation bug | Design flaw | Assumption error
- **Description**: What went wrong
- **Resolution**: How it was fixed
- **Spec Impact**: What should be added/changed in the spec to prevent recurrence
